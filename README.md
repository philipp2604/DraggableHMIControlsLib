## Description 
<p>This is a simple WIP library of draggable WPF controls for use in HMI applications.</p>
<p>Included are guide lines and grid-like snapping with customizable spacings for moving controls around.</p>

**<p>This library is in a very early WIP state and right now more a proof of concept than anything else.</p>**

<p><sup>No, I didn't want to use extensions for the existing controls.</sup></p>

## Notes
Not included are helper classes 'ObservableObject' and 'RelayCommand' for the ViewModels. Those can be easily replaced with classes from other MVVM packages.
